# Dolphin
Species Distribution Model for Dolphins Family
# Introduction

This is a final project of the course: **Introduction to Programming and Geostatistics within the Master Program Applied Earth Observation and Geoanalysis** at the University of WÃ¼rzburg with Professors Dr. Martin Wegmann and Dr. Jackob Schwalb-Willmann.

The project consists of several stages and has as a long-term goal the application of ecological niche modeling tools to determine the areas of highest species richness of the _Delphinidae_ family and their interaction with the main fishing grounds and marine protected areas of the Western North Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.

In this first phase, we will start with an academic exercise using the _Stenella clymene_ or Clymene dolphin species to define the basis of the algorithm to be used for all species. Clymene dolphins are also known as "short-snouted spinners" because they often spin when they jump out of the water. Although there are no known major conservation problems for this species, it is likely that there are some undocumented problems. Some dolphins are killed in directed fisheries in the Caribbean, and others incidentally in nets throughout most of their range _(Jefferson, 2018)_
